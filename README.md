Sure! Here are the programming project ideas rewritten in Markdown format:

1. **To-Do List Manager:**
   Create a console-based application that allows users to add, remove, and view tasks in a to-do list. Implement functionalities like marking tasks as completed, saving the list to a file, and loading it back.

2. **Calculator:**
   Build a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Optionally, add more advanced features like handling parentheses or trigonometric functions for a challenge.

3. **Word Count Tool:**
   Develop a program that takes a text file as input and counts the number of words, lines, and characters in the file. You can also implement additional features like finding the most common words or displaying statistics.

4. **Temperature Converter:**
   Create a program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. You may also add support for Kelvin and other temperature units if desired.

5. **File Encryption/Decryption:**
   Implement a basic file encryption and decryption tool. Allow users to provide a key or password to encrypt a file and later decrypt it using the same key.

6. **Hangman Game:**
   Design a simple command-line version of the classic Hangman game. The program should choose a random word, and the player must guess the letters one by one until they either solve the word or run out of attempts.

7. **Random Password Generator:**
   Develop a program that generates random passwords with specified lengths and complexity levels. Include options to choose whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

8. **Currency Converter:**
   Create a program that converts one currency to another based on the latest exchange rates. You can fetch the exchange rates from an online API.

9. **Guess the Number Game:**
   Design a number guessing game where the computer generates a random number, and the player must guess it within a certain number of attempts. Provide hints like "higher" or "lower" after each guess.

10. **Calendar Application:**
    Build a simple console-based calendar application that allows users to view and manage events for specific dates. Implement functionalities like adding, editing, and deleting events.

Remember, the goal of a weekend project is to have fun, learn something new, and practice your programming skills. Choose a project that interests you the most, and don't hesitate to add your own creative touches to make it unique! Happy coding!
